One day, the chicken was taking a walk as usual. 
Suddenly, as it passed by the duck house, it noticed that the duck was gone. 
On the ground, there were only a few feathers and a pool of blood. 
The chicken was terrified and cried out loudly, summoning all the nearby animals.

All the animals in the farm gathered and began to analyze the scene.
The chicken said, "This is terrible. Could something have happened to the duck?"
The dog said, "The feathers smell like the duckâ€™s. They really do belong to the duck."
The bull said, "The duck was still here yesterday. Who could have murdered the duck?"
The goose said, "Nobody except us was here since yesterday. It can only be one of us."
Now, they must decide, who could have done such a cruel thing?

The duck murdered itself? Uhhhhh, why would it commit suicide? Probably because the weather is getting to hot these days. Or it's just because you don't want to accuse against each other. You get to live here together after all. It's awkward you know? Then the duck it is.

You've decided the murderer to be the chicken. To avoid another death, you must report this to the human and make chicken into roast chicken. Though the duck probably is the only one here that the chicken have a chance to win in battle, the dog is looking forward to some treats no matter what.

You've decided the murderer to be the dog. What a shame on you, dog! You are supposed to guard us, but you murdered the duck! You deserved to be punished! Report this to the human!

option: Control that dog! -> duck_returned

state: bull

You've decided the murderer to be the bull. How can you do this to the duck? Bull! We all could have been the duck. But it's probably too expensive for the human to kill as it's the breeding cattle and is worth a LOT. So maybe lock it up in the bull pen.
>>>
option: Control that bull! ...? Maybe just let it be. -> duck_returned

state: goose

You've decided the murderer to be the goose. What it took from the duck must be taken. Let the human sell the goose and buy ten ducks instead. This pond will belong to the ducks! Make the ducks great again!
