Narrator: In the late 20xxs, a global trade war escalated into a devastating worldwide conflict.
When the smoke cleared, nations were gone. Corporations and city-states rose in their place.
The world fractured into “faultline cities” — divided by class, power, and resources.
>>>
option: Continue. -> intro2

state: intro2

<<<
Narrator: Starfall City is one such vertical metropolis.
At the top lies Starim, ruled by corporations, gleaming with glass towers and purified air.
At the bottom sprawls The Fall — a wasteland of scrap tech, gangs, black markets, and experiments gone wrong.
Between them is Breakline, where fixers and smugglers profit from both sides.
>>>
option: Continue. -> intro3

Narrator: Omnireach is the hub of everything that moves.
Cargo, weapons, secrets — legal or not, everything flows through its ports.
Pay the fee, and your goods are safe inside the city.
Step outside, and you’d better hire mercenaries… or risk becoming prey for raiders.
>>>
option: Continue. -> intro4

Narrator: In The Fall, District C, there is a bar called The Mute Lift.
Old neon, a dusty stage, arcade machines — nothing unusual at first glance.
But behind its facade lies a secret: it is a meeting point for the Duskrise Protocol.
>>>
option: Continue. -> intro5

state: intro5
text:
<<<
Narrator: The Duskrise were once engineers and scientists who helped build Starim.
Cast out by the elites, they now plot revenge.
Their plan: pierce the barriers between The Fall and Starim, unleash chaos, and ignite revolution.
Their hidden elevator is the first breach — a path straight into the upper city.

option: Continue. -> intro6

Narrator: You are Null Directive — a covert agent hired through Omnireach’s private network.
Your mission: infiltrate The Mute Lift, secure an invitation to the Duskrise meeting,
and uncover what’s coming next for Starfall City.

To get the invitation, you have to talk to Raze - the leader of a brotherhood of The Fall. He has an invitation, but whether you can get him to give you that is another thing.
>>>
option: Talk to Raze. -> r1

state: r1
text:
<<<
Raze: …What?
>>>
option: I'm here for the invitation. -> r2
option: Doesn’t look like you’re in a hurry to drink that. -> r3
option: You’re Raze. Ash Brotherhood. Heard your name before. -> r4
option: Nothing much. Just sitting. -> r5

state: r2
text:
<<<
Raze: I don’t know what you’re talking about.
>>>
option: Don’t play dumb. You really want me to spell it out? The invitation—for the Duskrise Protocol meeting. -> r6
option: Alright. Guess I was mistaken. My bad. Nevermind. -> r1

state: r3

Raze: “Just because a drink’s sitting in front of you doesn’t mean you should take it.
Could be fine liquor. Could be poison.”
>>>
option: True enough. This one smells like poison to me. -> r7
option: Indeed. -> r1

state: r4
text:
<<<
Raze: Name gets around. Yours doesn’t.
>>>
option: Name’s Null. Pleasure. -> r1
option: You don’t need to know who I am. -> r8
option: I’m not local. I’m with Omnireach. -> r9

state: r5

Raze: Whatever.
>>>
option: Quit this mission. -> game_start


state: r6

Raze: Watch your tone. This ain’t your house.
>>>
option: [You failed the task.] -> game_start

state: r7
text:
<<<
Raze: …So tell me — what do you think I should do with a glass of poison?
>>>
option: If you know it’s poison, then there's no point drinking it. -> r10
option: Maybe it’s better to let someone else drink it. -> r11

state: r8
text:
<<<
Raze: And I don’t need to talk to you either.
>>>
option: [You failed the task.] -> game_start

state: r9
text:
<<<
Raze: [raises an eyebrow] Omnireach? You’re fast. What, the reputation of our little tea party upstairs get this high these days?
>>>
option: Of course. We’re professionals when it comes to this sort of thing. -> r19
option: In Omnireach, you might call it a reputation. Down here in the Fall… let’s be honest — infamy fits better. -> r20

state: r10

Raze: “When a drink’s been poured, it’s rude to just toss it out.
If you’re bored, go grab your own glass.
Stop staring at mine.”
>>>
option: [You failed the task.] -> game_start

state: r11
text:
<<<
Raze: Funny. You know it’s poison, and you expect someone else to take the hit?
>>>
option: And how would they know it’s poison? -> r12
option: One man's poison is another man's meat. -> r13

state: r12
text:
<<<
Raze: [shakes head] …Help the kind, and I bury them. Help the mad, and I burn the street.
>>>
option: [You failed the task.] -> game_start

state: r13
text:
<<<
Raze: Makes you wonder… who’d taste poison and call it meat.
>>>
option: Closer than you think. -> r14

state: r14
text:
<<<
Raze: [eyes you up] Where’d you come from… that you can stomach a drink like this?
>>>
option: Starim. -> r15
option: The Fall. -> r16
option: Omnireach. -> r17

state: r15
text:
<<<
Raze: [scoffs] Oh, a Starim noble playing lost in the Fall? Cute. But when did prey ever volunteer to guide the predator?

Raze: A calf who thinks they can take a bite out of a tiger — either an idiot, or a nut. Neither I’d bother.

Raze: [eyes narrowing] Hmph. Didn’t take long for the hyenas to catch the scent of blood.
>>>
option: We’re professional hunters, after all. -> r18

state: r18
text:
<<<
Raze: Haha, alright then. Hope this piece of meat doesn’t choke you on the way down.
>>>
option: [Congrats! You got the invitation!] -> end

state: r19
text:
<<<
Raze: Professionals know the rule. You want something, you pay for it. I don’t run a charity.
>>>
option: Mmm… bit tight on funds lately. On credit? -> r21
option: Money is not the only form of payment. -> r22

state: r20
text:
<<<
Raze: Oh? If you know so much, then tell me — how is a chance for the people down here to finally rise up something infamous to the Fall?
>>>
option: Well, since you’re playing this game, I’ll play my part. -> r25

state: r21
text:
<<<
Raze: Deal’s off. Door’s that way.
>>>
option: [You failed the task.] -> game_start

state: r22
text:
<<<
Raze: If not money, then what?
>>>
option: Take a problem off your hands — sounds like a fair trade to me. -> r23

state: r23
text:
<<<
Raze: Aha! A grand feast like this. The turning point of the Fall’s destiny. How could that possibly be a problem?
>>>
option: If it weren’t a problem, you’d already be up there. But here you are — drinking alone and burning time. -> r24

state: r24
text:
<<<
Raze: [stares in silence; something in his eyes shifts, heavy as the city above.]
>>>
option: Continue. -> r25

state: r25
text:
<<<
Null: You already know.
Those self-serving egos dressed up as revolutionaries…
They don’t care about the people down here.
They don’t care about you. Or your brothers. Or your families.

Very soon, the Fall will call you a traitor for not showing up.
And if you do show up, but refuse to bleed for their so-called uprising —
you’ll be even more of one.

So maybe… it’s better if your ticket just happened to get stolen.
Makes the future a little easier to live with.
>>>
option: Continue. -> r26

state: r26
text:
<<<
Raze: …Funny thing. The ticket just happened to slip out of my pocket.
Pure accident.

option: [Congrats! You got the invitation!] -> end

THE END.
